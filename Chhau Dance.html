		<div class="Chhau">
		<p>Chhau is a type of ancient dance. It evolved from the mock battles of the Oriya Paikas (warriors), who battled rhythmically to the accompaniment of indigenous musical instruments. It is common in the districts of Mayurbhanj in Orissa, Sareikela in Bihar, and Purulia in West Bengal. Under various royal sponsorship, the dancing genre was nourished and evolved. Mayurbhanj's biggest patron was Maharaja Krishana Chandra Bhanj Deo. Chhau is essentially a festive dance performed on the occasion of the Bengali calendar's sun festival, which occurs around the end of the month of Chaitra. Chhau is now performed not just at this solar festival, but also at many other festivals throughout the year.</p>
